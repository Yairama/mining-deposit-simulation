The objective of this project is to simulate three reservoir characteristics: lithology, alterations and grades.

For this we used a Gaussian simulation (which is not correct and should be corrected in the future, read the warning section at the end).

### Grades

### Litho

### Alter

## Warning: One of the objectives to correct is that the simulation is of Gaussian type (normal) which is not real, it is necessary to refocus the simulation to have a distribution skewed to the left, where the mode is less than the median, and this in turn less than the mean.
Hope you enjoy this project and feel free to contribute with suggestions and improvements. Thanks for your interest!
